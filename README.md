# HaloCaster

This is a repo for applications that facilitate stream overlays that provided modern caster features and information for the original Halo trilogy titles. There are currently working casters for Halo: CE, and Halo 2. They lean on neutral hosts (also known as dedis) that run within the original xbox emulator, [XEMU](https://xemu.app/) as we need to be able to read the memory for at least one xbox involved in the match. In theory you could certainly run these applications on real hardware via devkits or modified xboxes, but in practice that isn't very convenient with the only advantage of possible marginal performance gains.
